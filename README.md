# sunspot-dashboard

The information on sunspots in this dashboard derives from the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center, a department of the Royal Observatory of Belgium. Sunspots appear on the sun as dark marks since they have lower temperatures than other parts of the sunâ€™s surface. Magnetic fields prevent heat from the sun from reaching the surface at sunspot locations. This dashboard features real-time images of the sun taken with distinct filters. It also monitors the sunspot counts over time since more than 270 years ago. These counts are presented on a line chart with one line presenting the raw sunspot counts and one representing the average sunspot values over a user-defined number of observation periods. There is also a panel projecting the average sunspot counts per year. A scatterplot also exists to accentuate the variability of the sunspot cycle.
